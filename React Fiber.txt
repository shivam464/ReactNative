Q1- what is reconciliation?
Ans:-
    In React Native, reconciliation is the process React uses to efficiently update the user interface (UI) on the screen to match changes in component state or props .

Q2- what is Diffing ?
Ans:- 
    Diffing: The new virtual tree is compared with the previous version using React's diffing algorithm. This algorithm identifies exactly what has changed, added, or been removed in the UI tree.


Q3- What is Virtual DOM/Tree?
Ans:- 

    Virtual DOM/Tree: The in-memory, lightweight representation of the UI.
    Manipulating this virtual representation is much faster than directly manipulating the actual native views.

Q4- what is Keys?
Ans:-

    Keys: When rendering lists of elements, using a stable, unique key prop for each item is crucial. 
    This helps React identify which specific items have changed, been added, or removed, allowing it to efficiently reuse existing native views and preserve component state across re-renders, rather than destroying and recreating the entire list.


Q5- What is React Fiber?
Ans:- 

    React Fiber: Modern React (including current React Native versions) uses the Fiber architecture, a re-implementation of the core reconciliation algorithm.
     Fiber allows the update work to be broken into chunks, paused, and resumed, which improves responsiveness and enables features like concurrent rendering.
